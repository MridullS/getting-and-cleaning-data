 
Dataset Background
The data is from experiments performed in UCI.

Feature Selection
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial (X, Y, and Z) raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ
These time domain signals (prefix 't') were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered to remove noise. The acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals

tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag
The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are (remove other estimation that will be used in this transformation):
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:
gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
Transformation
Based on the following 5 steps, the tidy dataset is gradually generated. This transformation only includes "subject_test.txt", "subject_train.txt", "X_teat.txt", "X_train.txt", "y_test.txt" and "y_train.txt". Only mean and standard deviation are kept in the merged dataset. Labeling activities and refining variables names give readible ability. The final goal is to create a Tidy dataset including one subject, one activity, and one average.
Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
Use the numeric ID in "activity_labels.txt" to link back the numeric values in the dataset (y_test/y_train) and find out the activity names.

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
Use "features.txt" to label variable names
Change "f" to "freq"
Change "t" to "time"
Change "-" to "."
Remove "()"
